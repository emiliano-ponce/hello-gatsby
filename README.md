# Gatsby Movies

A small application for me to learn [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io), and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org).

- Gets movie information from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US)
- Allows users to search for and pin movies to the home screen. Stores pinned movies in localstorage
- Fully typed out using TypeScript.
- Responsive, mobile first design. Supports Chrome & Safari.
